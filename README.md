iFlex is a visual fitness tracker designed to help you document and monitor your fitness journey more effectively than just relying on a scale. Whether your goal is weight loss, muscle gain, body recomposition, or simply tracking progress after your latest challenge, iFlex provides the perfect tool to see your transformation.

With iFlex, you can create dedicated photo albums to capture your journey over time. Each time you take a new photo, you can overlay a previous image, allowing you to align them perfectly and easily see how far you've come. This feature helps you precisely compare your progress, making your achievements more visible and motivating!
